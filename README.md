one(1)CRM for Synology 

Installation of the customer relationship management system 1CRM is possible on the DiskStation Manager in the "web" directory in version 7 below the LinuxNginxMysqlPHP stack.
However, the directory-specific configuration file ".htaccess" provided here must also be stored in a "1CRM" product directory after the software has been extracted, e.g. to avoid "error 500" and to be able to carry out the product installation.
